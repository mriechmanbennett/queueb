# queueb
An open source 10 man queue bot for discord.

The priority of this project is to make organizing ten mans less painful.

It will initially be written with Rainbow Six Siege in mind, but it will be expanded for more general use with configurable game lobby sizes in the future.
Starting with a simple queue bot, functionality will expand over time.

To set up:
Include a text file named secret.txt that contains only your bot API key. It should be in a directory above the directory housing queueb.py. 
Execute queueb.py
Add the bot to your server, and give it a role restricting it to just your 10s channel to avoid a lot of spam.
