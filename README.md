# queueb
An open source 10 player queue bot for discord.

Written with Rainbow Six Siege in mind.

To set up:
Include a text file named secret.txt that contains only your bot API key. It should be in a directory above the directory housing queueb.py. 
Execute queueb.py
Add the bot to your server, and give it a role restricting it to just your 10s channel to avoid a lot of spam.
