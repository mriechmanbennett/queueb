# queueb
An open source 10 man queue bot for discord.

The priority of this project is to make organizing ten mans less painful.

It will initially be written with Rainbow Six Siege in mind, but it will be expanded for more general use with configurable game lobby sizes in the future.
Starting with a simple queue bot, functionality will expand over time.
