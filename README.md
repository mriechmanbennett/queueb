# queueb
An open source 10 man queue bot for discord. The others are irritating to configure, cost money, or are deprecated.

The priorities of this project are for it to be free, easy to set up, well documented, and functional.

It will initially be written with Rainbow Six Siege in mind, but it will be expanded for more general use in the future.
Starting with a simple queue bot that will generate a lobby when it's full, but will add elo when basic functionality is completed..
