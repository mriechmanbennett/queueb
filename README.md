# queueb
An open source 10 man queue bot for discord.

It will initially be written with Rainbow Six Siege in mind, but it will be expanded for more general use with configurable game lobby sizes in the future.

To set up:
Include a text file named secret.txt that contains only your bot API key. It should be in a directory above the directory housing queueb.py. 
Execute queueb.py
Add the bot to your server, and give it a role restricting it to just your 10s channel to avoid a lot of spam.

Feel free to email me with any questions you may have.

This code is aggressively bad, I apologize in advance
