HIGH PRIORITY:
	-queue time-outs, 20-30 minutes

	-refactor to have commands separated into cogs that are loaded by the main
	-improve the CustomHelpCommand implementation so it's not a static return
	-write a startup/monitoring script to keep bot up/restart it after reboots
	-consider using true user id instead of user name, and deriving the uname from the id when a print function is executed on the queue. This would protect against nitro users exploiting username changes.
	-fix async-related problem of the same queue popping multiple times
	-implement match and player tracking to store wins in preparation for elo implementation

REGISTRATION:
	-store user registration in a pickle file, leave fields for elo and game wins
	-do checks for registration when a player attempts to join the queue

MOD COMMANDS:
	-put mod commands in a cog, reliant on the mod role in bro league server
	-implement unpop queue to restore lobby
	-remove individual player from queue/game
		-corollary: allow individual player added to queue/game
	-banned list?

-learn how to use the issues tab on github because that seems better for this

TESTING:
	-maybe write a second bot with a command to join it to the queue?
	-produce additional test functions
	-lock test functions behind admin role, probably in a separate cog
		-forcePop is a good example
		-consider excluding test functions from main builds, but idk how
	-write a test function to allow adding dummy users to the queue


Notes:
-established testing branch to keep separate from the main that is in use on the pi server
-asyncio.ensure_future() seems like the answer to my queue timeout problem

New features since last update:
	-capital letters
	-bot dms all players when the queue has popped. a little less spammythan a mass @ in the 10s channel
	-minor backend improvements
