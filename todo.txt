-refactor to remove global variables for lobby and game queues
-convert lobby and game queues to dictionaries with the username
	as key and the time they joined the queue as value
-refactor to have commands separated into cogs that are loaded by the main
-give the CustomHelpCommand class its own file that is imported to main
-write a startup script
-write a test function to allow adding dummy users to the queue
-consider using true user id instead of user name, and deriving the uname
	from the id when a print function is executed on the queue
	This would protect against nitro users exploiting username
	changes.
-consider making a custom queue class for the project

REGISTRATION:
-store user registration in a pickle file, leave fields for elo and game wins
-do checks for registration when a player attempts to join the queue

MOD COMMANDS:
-either store a pickle file with mod user ids, or rely on a mod role
