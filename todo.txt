high priority:
queue time-outs, 20-30 minutes

-refactor to have commands separated into cogs that are loaded by the main
-improve the CustomHelpCommand implementation so it's not a static return
-write a startup/monitoring script to keep bot up/restart it after reboots
-write a test function to allow adding dummy users to the queue
-consider using true user id instead of user name, and deriving the uname
	from the id when a print function is executed on the queue
	This would protect against nitro users exploiting username
	changes.
-fix async-related problem of the same queue popping multiple times
-implement match and player tracking to store wins in preparation for elo implementation

REGISTRATION:
-store user registration in a pickle file, leave fields for elo and game wins
-do checks for registration when a player attempts to join the queue

MOD COMMANDS:
-put mod commands in a cog, reliant on the mod role in bro league server
-implement unpop queue to restore lobby
-remove individual player from queue

-banned list?

-learn how to use the issues tab on github because that seems better for this


Notes:
-established testing branch to keep separate from the main that is in use on the pi server
-asyncio.ensure_future() seems like the answer to my queue timeout problem
